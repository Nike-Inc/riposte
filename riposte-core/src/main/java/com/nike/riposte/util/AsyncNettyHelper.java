/**
 * Helper class that provides static methods for dealing with async stuff in Netty/Riposte, mainly providing easy ways
 * to support distributed tracing and logger MDC when hopping threads using {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture}s. There are various {@code *WithTracingAndMdc(...)} methods for wrapping
 * objects with the same type that knows how to handle tracing and MDC. You can also call the various {@code
 * linkTracingAndMdcToCurrentThread(...)} and {@code unlinkTracingAndMdcFromCurrentThread(...)} methods directly if
 * you want to do it manually yourself.
 * <p/>
 * If you want to use the link and unlink methods manually to wrap some chunk of code, the general procedure looks like
 * this:
 * <pre>
 *  Pair&lt;Deque&lt;Span>, Map&lt;String, String>> originalThreadInfo = null;
 *  try {
 *      originalThreadInfo = AsyncNettyHelper.linkTracingAndMdcToCurrentThread(...);
 *      // Code that needs wrapping goes here
 *  }
 *  finally {
 *      AsyncNettyHelper.unlinkTracingAndMdcFromCurrentThread(originalThreadInfo);
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * Following this procedure guarantees that the code you want wrapped will be wrapped successfully with whatever tracing
 * and MDC info you want, but when it finishes the trace and MDC info will be put back the way it was as if your code
 * never ran. If you deviate from this then you risk having traces stomp on each other or other weird interactions that
 * you never expect or predict can mess up your tracing, so make sure you know what you're doing and test it thoroughly
 * under load if you deviate from this procedure.
