/**
 * Extension of {@link IdleStateHandler} intended to catch when an HTTP call is incomplete - i.e. when
 * a caller sends some of the data required for a full HTTP request but does not finish it. This could happen because
 * of a really slow client, or a bad network connection that keeps the connection open but doesn't send data, or a
 * broken client that doesn't send requests that conform to the HTTP spec. In any case we want to catch these cases
 * and send back an error response rather than waiting indefinitely for data that isn't going to come, consuming
 * resources the entire time. Without this handler these bad calls would essentially become a memory leak.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: This is still an *idle* timeout handler, so if the caller is still sending data (even if it's a really slow
 * trickle) it will not trigger this handler's timeout logic. It will only timeout and close the connection if no
 * incoming or outgoing data has passed through the channel *at all* in {@link #idleTimeoutMillis} milliseconds.
